## Welcome! 

#### In the interest of supporting the ever-increasing importance of reproducibility in scientific research, we felt strongly that a public code repository for the analyses we support is not only a bonus of the Tropical Data system, but is our **responsibility** and is in keeping with our collaborative relationships with the countries we support.

#### We hope you find this repository useful and we encourage you to send suggestions or questions to our support email address at support@tropicaldata.org. For more information about the Tropical Data service, please refer to our [website](https://www.tropicaldata.org/).

##### Get started by downloading the your MOH full approved dataset [here](https://www.tropicaldata.org/downloads). See screenshot below for correct download.

For the sake of illustration, we are going to name our working directory **WorkingDirectoryR**. See below for the correct folder structure, with indentations to indicate correct subfolder branches:
